# -Automated-Motion-Detection-and-Email-Notification-System
This project implements an automated motion detection system that captures real-time video feed, identifies motion within the frames, and triggers email notifications when motion is detected. The system is built using OpenCV for video processing, and integrates with an email service to send alerts with snapshots of the detected motion.

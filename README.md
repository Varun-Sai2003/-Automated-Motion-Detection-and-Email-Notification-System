# Automated-Motion-Detection-and-Email-Notification-System
This project implements an automated motion detection system that captures real-time video feed, identifies motion within the frames, and triggers email notifications when motion is detected. The system is built using OpenCV for video processing, and integrates with an email service to send alerts with snapshots of the detected motion.

# Key-Features:
Real-Time Motion Detection: Utilizes OpenCV to process live video streams and detect movement.
Email Alerts: Automatically sends an email notification with an attached image of the detected motion.
Customizable Sensitivity: Allows adjustment of motion detection sensitivity to reduce false positives.
Platform Compatibility: Can be deployed on various platforms including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

# Use-Cases:
Home Security: Monitor your home and receive instant alerts when motion is detected.
Surveillance: Ideal for monitoring offices, warehouses, or any other sensitive areas.
Wildlife Observation: Can be used to detect and record wildlife movement in natural habitats.

# Technologies-Used:
Python: Core programming language for the system.
OpenCV: Library for image and video processing.
SMTP: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol used for sending email notifications.

# Future-enhancements:
-Raspberry Pi: Can be used for a compact and cost-effective setup.
-Multi camera Support
-Cloud integration
